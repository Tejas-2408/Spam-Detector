# Spam Detector Using Machine Learning

Welcome to the **Spam Detector** project! This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning project that classifies messages as spam or non-spam. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and deployment.

## Project Overview
Spam detection is a crucial task in email and message filtering, helping users avoid malicious and unwanted communications. This project builds a machine learning model to distinguish spam from legitimate messages using a step-by-step pipeline:
1. **Data Cleaning**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
3. **Train-Test Split**
4. **Model Selection and Training**
5. **Deployment on Render**

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and development
- **Render** for deployment

## Project Workflow
### 1. Data Cleaning
The raw data often contains noise such as null values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats. In this step, we:
- Removed duplicates and null entries
- Standardized text formatting
- Processed text (e.g., tokenization, removal of stop words)

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
To gain insights into the data, we conducted EDA:
- Visualized the distribution of spam vs. non-spam messages
- Identified key features such as word frequency
- Explored correlations and patterns within the data

### 3. Train-Test Split
To evaluate model performance, the dataset was split into training and test sets (e.g., 80/20 split).

### 4. Model Selection and Training
We tested multiple algorithms, including:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Na√Øve Bayes Classifier**
- **Random Forest**

The models were evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best-performing model was selected for deployment.

### 5. Deployment
The final model was deployed on **Render** to create an accessible web-based spam detection service.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-detector.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd spam-detector
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the `main.py` file or Jupyter Notebook to:
- Preprocess data
- Train and test models
- Deploy the web app

## Results
The model achieved an **accuracy of X%**, with precision and recall metrics indicating its reliability for spam classification.

## Deployment
The model is live and accessible [here](https://your-render-link.com). This deployment allows users to input text and receive real-time spam detection results.
